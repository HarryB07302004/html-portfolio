<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Harry Maliwat Bundang who is currently enrolled in University Of Baguio. I am currently taking BSIT in to that school. I also became a student of Dr. Angela Uy because I buy her tutorial in UDEMY.</p>

<p>This website is for only beginners who is currently learning some basic programming language that can maximize his skills and knowledge to that language. This website is intend to give some advices, proper way to use it, and etc.</p>

<p>In my personal opinion on taking a BSIT course is quite hard because when I enrolled to his course I don't have any background or knowledge in any language even an easiest one. I hope I can maximize my skills and apply it to my schooling when it is needed. I hope I can learn more about this and expand my knowledge on different programming language. Lord, help me to grow so I can be able to apply easy when I graduated.</p>
